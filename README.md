# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website project built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The design is intended to closely follow the layout and motion of the reference Instagram reel provided by the user, but personalized with the user's name and content.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the portfolio.

## Project Goals

- Recreate the look and feel of the provided Instagram reel as closely as possible
- Highlight the user's name, role, and key projects
- Use smooth animations and transitions suitable for a modern portfolio

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

- Implement the landing page layout and animations to match the reference reel
- Replace placeholder text with the user's real name and portfolio content
- Set up deployment (e.g., Vercel) once the design is ready
